# Space Monsters
Build monsters in a slick web interface!

This simple web app was created as a part of an Hour of Code lesson,
to show students how a monster can be effectively built using code,
starting from the principles explained in the lesson.

[Enjoy the web app](http://baxeico.github.io/hourofcode-monsters/)

I plan to traslate the web app in English, I will accept pull requests for translating in other languages.
