# Space Monsters
Build monsters in a slick web interface!

This simple web app was created as a part of an Hour of Code lesson,
to show students how a monster can be effectively built using code,
starting from the principles explained in the lesson.

[Enjoy the web app](http://baxeico.github.io/hourofcode-monsters/)

The web app is available in English and Italian, I will be happy to accept pull requests for adding other languages. See file translations.js.
